Findings Q1:
- there is a peak of average crime in the summer months (May-August) with the highest crime rate in July, 
one possible explanation could be longer days and warmer weather leading to more people spending time in the streets
and being possible victims of a crime. Also, in summer more tourists come to Chicago, so the number of pickpocket crimes might go up.
- interestingly, in February there are significantly less average crimes reported
 even if we account for the fewer number of days in this month.
 - These findings can be used to allocate more resources to protect citizens during the summer months while 
 cutting costs with less resources during the winter.
