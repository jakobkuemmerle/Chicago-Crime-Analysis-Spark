This information is essential in understanding how crime is dependend on neighborhood effects.

Findings c)
With a Chi-Squared of 0.35749999669028343 we can show that the mayors have no significant impact on crime in Chicago.
Other factors seem to prevail. One explanation is that politics take a ranger time to have an impact on society and also on crime.
A policy of a mayor might only be measurable years later when the mayor has already resigned. Furthermore, federal and state legislature
might play a bigger role than the decision of the mayor and the mayor is not deciding alone.
